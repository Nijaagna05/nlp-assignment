1) Take a custom paragraph, perform the entire pipeline and print results at each step
Paragraph:
"The rescue teams are working tirelessly to provide immediate help to the people affected by the flood."
Tokenization:
['The', 'rescue', 'teams', 'are', 'working', 'tirelessly', 'to', 'provide', 'immediate', 'help', 'to', 'the', 'people', 'affected', 'by', 'the', 'flood']
Stopword Removal:
['rescue', 'teams', 'working', 'tirelessly', 'provide', 'immediate', 'help', 'people', 'affected', 'flood']
Stemming:
['rescu', 'team', 'work', 'tireless', 'provid', 'immedi', 'help', 'peopl', 'affect', 'flood']
Lemmatization:
['rescue', 'team', 'work', 'tirelessly', 'provide', 'immediate', 'help', 'person', 'affect', 'flood']

2) Define NLP and its Real-Time Application in a Specific Domain
Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a branch of Artificial Intelligence that enables machines to read, understand, interpret, and generate human language. It combines concepts from linguistics, computer science, and machine learning to process text and speech effectively. NLP includes tasks such as tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, named entity recognition, machine translation, and sentiment analysis. Its core aim is to bridge the communication gap between humans and machines.
Real-Time Application (Healthcare Domain):
In healthcare, NLP is widely applied to improve efficiency and patient outcomes. Doctors, hospitals, and researchers produce large amounts of unstructured data such as clinical notes, prescriptions, and lab reports. NLP helps extract, organize, and analyze this information.
Some real-time healthcare applications include:
Medical Chatbots: Interacting with patients to provide preliminary advice and book appointments.
Clinical Decision Support: Analyzing patient data and suggesting possible diagnoses or treatments.
Voice-to-Text Systems: Converting doctor-patient conversations into structured digital medical records.
Text Mining in Research: Automatically scanning medical literature for disease trends, drug effects, or treatment outcomes.
By implementing NLP, healthcare systems become more efficient, reduce manual workload, and ensure faster and more accurate patient care.

3) What is NLU and NLG?
Natural Language Understanding (NLU):
NLU is a subfield of NLP that focuses on understanding the meaning of human language. It involves identifying user intent, extracting entities, analyzing sentiment, and interpreting context.
Example: If a user says “Book me a flight to Mumbai tomorrow morning”, the NLU system interprets:
Intent → Book a flight
Entity 1 → Mumbai (destination)
Entity 2 → Tomorrow morning (time)
NLU is used in chatbots, voice assistants like Siri and Alexa, smart customer support systems, and intelligent search engines.
Natural Language Generation (NLG):
NLG is another subfield of NLP that deals with producing human-like language from structured data or AI outputs. It converts raw data into coherent sentences, reports, or even full documents.
Example: Structured input {temperature: 30°C, city: Delhi, condition: Sunny} can be converted into: “The weather in Delhi is sunny with a temperature of 30°C.”
Applications of NLG include automatic financial or business report generation, AI-generated news articles, personalized marketing messages, and conversational agents.
In summary:
NLU is about understanding human input (interpretation).
NLG is about producing natural language output (generation).
Together, they form the backbone of modern conversational AI systems such as chatbots, customer service automation, and intelligent personal assistants.
